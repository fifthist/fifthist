I specialize in designing and developing scalable, reliable, available and performant distributed systems on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). I currently work on a multi-primary, regionally replicated and indexed document storage service. Additionally, I take pleasure in creating educational content and mentoring engineers. If you have any questions, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:skojoian.am@gmail.com).
