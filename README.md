### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking to tutor students in mathematics and theoretical computer science again, which is something Iâ€™ve always loved to do. Prior to switching to the software industry, I taught AP and competition (AMC, AIME) level mathematics and developed a passion for teaching.
If you are a high school student needing to strengthen your basics, prepare for mathematics competitions, or if you are an undergraduate mathematics or computer science student, I hope to hear from you!
